# ethereum-cleanergy
An Ethereum based client-side decentralized application for hypothetical use on electrical meters to gather data on energy consumption rates and increase the efficiency in energy usage.

This technology seeks to create a smoother transition between the usage of non-renewable and renewable energy sources by maximizing clean energy consumption while minimizing pollution levels, and at the same time, rewarding those who consume less energy than their regional average.

The web application will display energy consumption data in table and map view, providing the necessary information to see which regions have the highest and lowest energy consumption.
- Regions with the highest energy consumption rates would rely on non-renewable sources such as coal and natural gas
- Regions with the lowest energy consumption rates would rely on the less efficient renewable sources such as solar energy 

The network itself has its own minted cryptocurrency token, known as the Eco-Energy Token, or Eneco for short, which is rewarded to low energy consumers, contrary to the reward system of other major cryptocurrencies, which rely on high energy consumption to provide the computing power to validate transactions.

The Eneco tokens can be used to cover a portion of electrical bills, or donated to another consumer to provide for their electrical bills. The goal of this system is to create better opportunities for those in need of electricity, while incentivizing others to conserve electricity.
